# paper-review
My day-to-day paper searching, reading and reviewing

I post my research journey(of papers) here, including my daily paper searching and abstract recording of interesting conferences or topics, my reviews on particular papers, and admired skills for paper reading and writing.

An ambicious start is to record at least 3~5 abstracts of selected papers from the following conferences which I respect most,
1, SIGCOMM
2, MobiCom
3, NSDI
4, MobiSys
5, IMC
6, SIGMETRICS

Keep practicing till can't live without this habit
